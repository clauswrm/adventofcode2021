# Advent of Code 2021

Puzzle solutions written in Python. Solutions are presented as they were when the answers were submitted, with minor formatting applied.

My goal was to solve the problems as fast as possible, not to write the most efficient solution.

## Prepare solutions

Create a `.env` file with the content `SESSION_COOKIE=<your_aoc_session_cookie>`. Your session cookie can be found in your browser.

Run `./src/aoc.sh <day>` to create new puzzle solution folder with and download the input from adventofcode.com.

## Run solutions

Install dependencies with `pip3 install -r "requirements.txt"`.

Run the solutions with `python3 src/<day>/main.py`.
